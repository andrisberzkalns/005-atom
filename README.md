Research for creation of this project looked at a number of topics. Some of which I was not able to include, but need to be mentioned in order to highlight areas of improvement.

## Electron layers

Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: The first shell can hold up to two electrons, the second shell can hold up to eight (2 + 6) electrons, the third shell can hold up to 18 (2 + 6 + 10) and so on. The general formula is that the nth shell can in principle hold up to 2n2 electrons.
